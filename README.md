My project aims at pushing Elma Printers and Stationers to be at the same stage with the current growing technology needs. 
Elma Printers is going that direction by creating a website and exploring e-book intergration.

Creating Elma Printers and Stationers website will be a platform that will expose us to a wider market with users getting to know 
our products online and getting to know more information about Elma Printers and Stationers as well as getting feedback from our product users.

## UX
This project is a corprate site aimed at the general public, parents, teachers, learners, institutions a quicker means for 
them to know of what products and services are available at Elma Printers and Stationers, new products including their prices
and how best Elma Printers and Stationers can improve its services by getting feedback from the product user. 
The site aims to achieve increased brand awareness to the developer, I am putting into consideration why are we special and 
why would a user want this.
Our business goal is to create brand awareness and in line with our user needs that is our customer needs and business objectives
This site will include features such as inviting users for their feedback through contact page.
Another feature is the subscribe button for users to sign up for our newsletter.
The above features will help us know what the user needs.

## Features


### Existing Features
#### Feature 1
* Navigation bar: Every page has a navigation bar at the top which helps users to navigate through the pages
* Footer: Every page has a footer; the footer has a subscribe button where we invite the user to subscribe for our newsletter.
* The subscribe button has a modal making the pattern consistent
* In index.html I have used a full background image to cover a section I have created  at the top just below the navigation bar, 
  this is to invite our users with an attractive image at the top.
* Then below and just above the footer in index.html is our story section also a section I created about Elma Printers and 
  Stationers which has better spacing making it easier to read and process visually.
* I have also highlighted the subsribe and buy now buttons.
* There is color contrast where navigation bar and footer are blue and the buttons are red.
* There is font contrast where section titles use roboto and main section uses montserrat.
#### Feature 2
* Contact Page where the user is invited to give their feedback
#### Feature 3
* Topselling page where the user gets to see our products and theirprices
### Features Left to Implement
In future, i wish to put more functionality to the 'buy now' and 'subscribe' buttons
Also i would like to include a feature where users can be notified of new products for promotion in the market and special offer
whenever available.

## Technologies Used
* item 1 (like http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * item 1a used bootstrap because its responsive and its a mobile first framework
  * item 1b bootstrap being a HTML, CSS and JavasSript framework provided a rich selection of responsive classes to choose from
  * item 1c it helped me create a functional prototype in my index.html before building it further.
  * item 1d I did not have to know JavaScript yet i used it to create my modal with the subscribe button as well as collapsing navbar in smaller screens.
