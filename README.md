# Elma Printers and Stationers
My project aims at pushing Elma Printers and Stationers to be at the same stage with the current growing technology needs. 
Elma Printers is going that direction by creating a website and exploring e-book intergration.

Creating Elma Printers and Stationers website will be a platform that will expose us to a wider market with users getting to know 
our products online and getting to know more information about Elma Printers and Stationers as well as getting feedback from our product users.

## UX
This project is a corprate site aimed at the general public, parents, teachers, learners, institutions a quicker means for 
them to know of what products and services are available at Elma Printers and Stationers, new products including their prices
and how best Elma Printers and Stationers can improve its services by getting feedback from the product user. 
The site aims to achieve increased brand awareness to the developer, I am putting into consideration why are we special and 
why would a user want this.
Our business goal is to create brand awareness and in line with our user needs that is our customer needs and business objectives
This site will include features such as inviting users for their feedback through contact page.
Another feature is the subscribe button for users to sign up for our newsletter.
The above features will help us know what the uses needs.



* As a developer i want to create brand awareness
* As a developer i want to increase sales
* As a developer i want to get to know what my user needs because the project is user centered
* For users if they would use our product and why
* For users what they like out my product as a developer and any changes i could make.

I am going to focus on generating positive user experience and getting the product to fit the users needs and for the user to want to visit the site again.
by following the UX 5 planes which are:
 - strategy-business goals as well as user goals-determining what is relevant and culturally appropriate to the user.
 - scope - features to be incorporated, keeping the features simple,keeping the schedule controllabe, and setting out key milestones.
 - structure - How to group the data, information organisation.
 - skeleton - Working on wireframes, relationship of content, concerned with navigation design and interface design.
 - surface - the topography, developing a visual language that provides information and context. Including color, font images.

## Features

### Existing Features
#### Feature 1
* Navigation bar: Every page has a navigation bar at the top which helps users to navigate through the pages
* Footer: Every page has a footer; the footer has a subscribe button where we invite the user to subscribe for our newsletter.
* The subscribe button has a modal making the pattern consistent
* In index.html I have used a full background image to cover a section I have created  at the top just below the navigation bar, 
  this is to invite our users with an attractive image at the top.
* Then below and just above the footer in index.html is our story section also a section I created about Elma Printers and 
  Stationers which has better spacing making it easier to read and process visually.
* I have also highlighted the subsribe and buy now buttons.
* There is color contrast where navigation bar and footer are blue and the buttons are red.
* There is font contrast where section titles use roboto and main sections uses montserrat.

whenever available.

## Technologies Used
* Item 1 HTML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - for tructuring and presenting the content for the website.
* Item 2 CSS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - for styling in my project.
* item 2 (http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * item 1a used bootstrap because its responsive and its a mobile first framework
  * item 1b bootstrap being a HTML, CSS and JavasSript framework provided a rich selection of responsive classes to choose from
